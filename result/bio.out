Current Research
3D Human Shape Modeling from Video Imagery

We propose a robust framework that combines discriminative and           generative approaches for inferring 3D pose and anthropometric           characteristics of a person. In order to deal with loss of depth           information and resolve ambiguities, we use a combination of           techniques based on learned dynamical priors, biomechanical           characterization of human pose and multi-hypothesis tracking. Each of           the techniques aims to constrain the pose search to find the most           optimal pose and shape that best describes the person in the image.           The system is fully automatic and has modular architecture to support           extensibility and facilitate transition to operational deployment

I have implemented a version of the Hessian Free(truncated Newton) optimization approach that is based on JamesMartens's exposition of it in his paper that explored using HF for deeplearning (please see James Martens'sresearch page). Myparticular implementation was made possible with IlyaSutskever's guidance and some of the implementation choices havebeen made to make it easier to compare my code to various optimizershe has written. Despite Ilya's generous assistance, any bugs ordefects that might exist in the code I post here are my own. Pleasesee Ilya's publicationpage for code he has released for HF and recurrent neural nets. Itisn't too difficult to wrap his recurrent neural net model code in away that let's my optimizer code optimize it. Without furtherado, here is the code. The file is largebecause it also contains a copy of the curves dataset. The coderequires gnumpy to run and I recommendusing cudamat, writtenby Volodymyr Mnih, andrunning the code on a GPU and not in the slower simulation mode ofgnumpy.

Hans-Peter Kriegel has been a Professor of Informatics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Germany, since 1991. He has published over a wide range of data mining topics including clustering, outlier detection and high-dimensional data analysis. From the beginning of his research he was and still is working on spatial data management and similarity search, now in particular on searching and mining uncertain data, including uncertain spatio-temporal data. In 2009 the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) elected Professor Kriegel an ACM Fellow for his contributions to knowledge discovery and data mining, similarity search, spatial data management, and access-methods for high-dimensional data. So far, his more than 450 publications have been cited more than 30,000 times according to Google Scholar. Microsoft Academic Search currently ranks him Number 5 for field rating in the field of data mining.

Hu, Q., Huang, X. and Miao, J. Exploring a Multi-Source Fusion Approach for Genomics Information Retrieval, Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics &amp; Biomedicine, Hong Kong, China, December 18-21, 2010                                                                                                ABSTRACT: In this paper, we focus on the biomedicine domain                      to propose a multi-source fusion approach for improving information retrieval performance. First, we consider a common                      scenario for a metasearch system that has access to multiple baselines with retrieving and ranking documents/passages                      by their own models. Second, given selected baselines from                      multiple sources, we employ two modiﬁed fusion rules in                      the proposed approach, reciprocal and combMNZ, to rerank the candidates as the output for evaluation. Third, our                      empirical study on both 2007 and 2006 genomics data sets                      demonstrates the viability of the proposed approach to better                      performance fusion. Fourth, the experimental results show that                      the reciprocal method provides notable improvements on the                      individual baseline, especially on the effective passage MAP,                      the passage2-level and the diversity MAP, the aspect-level.

The chemistry and pharmacological activity of plants used in Anglo-Saxon England included St John’s Wort, Yarrow and White Horehound, all currently sold as over the counter botanicals. St John’s Wort is also sold in standardised pharmaceutical formulations to treat mild depression and at high strength is a prescription only medicine (POM). This truly world-leading output rapidly cements the seminal review with laboratory data on the antimicrobial activity of three native plants commonly used for wound-healing in Medieval times. Several of the plant formulations reflecting those used in Anglo-Saxon England were as active as the antimicrobial drug chloramphenicol against common Gram positive wound pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. This multi-disciplinary approach involved linguists, ethnobotanists, medical historians, chemists, pharmacologists, pharmaceutical scientists and herbal practitioners. Using the bioinformatic technology developed by MRG, this paper has already had significant impact in shedding light via rigorous scientific data on the evidence based for medicine as far back as the so-called “Dark Ages”. The work has signalled a higher impact for medical historians’ outputs, created a new area of scientific research on Medieval Medicine and created notable research links with University of Cambridge, the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists (USA) and Kew Gardens.

The goal of my future laboratory is to uncover the mechanisms that enable germ cells to pass on the genetic material, epigenetic information and cytoplasmic constituents through the generations. The mysteries of germ-line specific small silencing RNAs, piRNAs, continues to excite me. After identifying the first transcription factor that initiates piRNA precursor transcription, I propose to understand the structure of the precursor transcripts and its mode of post-transcriptional processing as my short-term career goal.

In July, 2011, I received my PhD degree in Computer Science and Software at Dalian University of Technology, China, with Prof. Hongfei Lin. During my PhD program, I was awarded a China Government Scholarship to support me studying in Canada for 2 years and 3 months. I was actively involved in TREC evaluation and other academic activities. With our own in-house information retrieval platform, we have achieved the best performance in several information retrieval tasks in TREC evaluation conference, such as Relevance Feedback Track 2009 and Chemical Track 2009. I have also published a number of papers in prestigious conferences and journals such as ACM CIKM, SIGIR and JASIST. For more information, please refer to my CV.

Apple Inc.'s Back To My Mac (BTMM) service provides a nice mobility awarehome networking solution not by proposing a bunch of new protocols, but byputting together a set of existing protocols and software tools. Users getconnectivity to the machines at home regardless of whether they are on moveor behind a NAT. We present the design of BTMM and propose extensions tomake it a potential solution for general home networking problem.
