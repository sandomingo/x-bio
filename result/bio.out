Automatic extraction and representation of visual concepts and           semantic information in scene is a desired capability in any security           and surveillance operations. In this project we target the problem of           visual event recognition in network information environment, where           faulty sensors, lack of effective visual processing tools and           incomplete domain knowledge frequently cause uncertainty in the data           set and consequently, in the visual primitives extracted from it. We           adopt Markov Logic Network (MLN), that combines probabilistic           graphical models and first order logic, to address the task of           reasoning under uncertainty. MLN is a knowledge representation           language that combines domain knowledge, visual concepts and           experience to infer simple and complex real-world events. MLN           generalizes over the existing state-of-the-art probabilistic models,           including hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, and stochastic           grammars. Moreover, the framework can be made scalable to support           variety of entities, activities and interactions that are typically           observed in the real world.

This book starts by introducing the operating environment of airlines, the evolution of airline networks, the driving economic forces behind airline scheduling and the general practices of airline schedule planning procedures. Airline operations at airports are discussed in detail in Chapter 2 including activities by airlines at airports, the uncertainties involved in daily operations, and the impact of uncertain disruptions on the management of airline operations. Chapter 3 explores the issues in managing daily aircraft turnaround operations, combining industry practices and mathematical models for managing airline ground operations at airports. The network effects of airline operations in Chapter 4 outlines the impact of stochastic disruptions on airline networks, followed by operational management of complex airline networks and on-time performance in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 starts by introducing readers the emerging concept of robust airline scheduling and operational reliability of airline networks. Recent advances in modelling and optimising airline operations and airline schedules are discussed and examples are given from real-world cases. Mathematical models widely used in the industry for solving airline operations and management issues are discussed in the book. Further details of these models are placed in the Appendix for interested and advanced readers.

RESULTS:                      In the proposed approach, we first consider a common scenario for a metasearch system that has access to multiple baselines with retrieving and ranking documents/passages by their own models. Then, given selected baselines from multiple sources, we investigate three modified fusion methods in the proposed approach, reciprocal, CombMNZ and CombSUM, to re-rank the candidates as the outputs for evaluation. Our empirical study on both 2007 and 2006 genomics data sets demonstrates the viability of the proposed approach for obtaining better performance. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the reciprocal method provides notable improvements on the individual baseline, especially on the passage2-level MAP and the aspect-level MAP.

The chemistry and pharmacological activity of plants used in Anglo-Saxon England included St John’s Wort, Yarrow and White Horehound, all currently sold as over the counter botanicals. St John’s Wort is also sold in standardised pharmaceutical formulations to treat mild depression and at high strength is a prescription only medicine (POM). This truly world-leading output rapidly cements the seminal review with laboratory data on the antimicrobial activity of three native plants commonly used for wound-healing in Medieval times. Several of the plant formulations reflecting those used in Anglo-Saxon England were as active as the antimicrobial drug chloramphenicol against common Gram positive wound pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. This multi-disciplinary approach involved linguists, ethnobotanists, medical historians, chemists, pharmacologists, pharmaceutical scientists and herbal practitioners. Using the bioinformatic technology developed by MRG, this paper has already had significant impact in shedding light via rigorous scientific data on the evidence based for medicine as far back as the so-called “Dark Ages”. The work has signalled a higher impact for medical historians’ outputs, created a new area of scientific research on Medieval Medicine and created notable research links with University of Cambridge, the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists (USA) and Kew Gardens.

The goal of my future laboratory is to uncover the mechanisms that enable germ cells to pass on the genetic material, epigenetic information and cytoplasmic constituents through the generations. The mysteries of germ-line specific small silencing RNAs, piRNAs, continues to excite me. After identifying the first transcription factor that initiates piRNA precursor transcription, I propose to understand the structure of the precursor transcripts and its mode of post-transcriptional processing as my short-term career goal.
